Can you guarantee your customers the lowest price? Flubit makes it possible!

Selling a product on Flubit is not a whole lot different than selling on any other market. However, you don't list your products on Flubit in a way where customers are able to see your products and offers. It all works a little bit differently here.

## How are items sold on Flubit?

Customers who have already found an item on a different online market simply copy the URL in their browser and paste it on flubit.com. If you sell this item at a lower price than the original link, then Flubit will offer your item to the customer and you will receive the order! 

## How much will it cost?

One of the main reasons why it's possible to offer a lower price on Flubit is because sellers can list their products free of charge on this platform. Since you do not need to pay a commission for your products like you do on other markets, you can sell your product at a much lower price. Use a price column to specify a minimum price for all of the products that you list on Flubit.

## Where and how can you use Flubit?

Flubit is completely integrated in plentymarkets. It is configured the same as other markets. Take a look at the Flubit page of the [manual](https://knowledge.plentymarkets.com/en/omni-channel/multi-channel/flubit) for information on how this is done.

The British company made its debut in 2012 and has already taken the UK by storm. At the moment, its services are available for links from online stores and markets that have a UK URL. In other words, customers can use Flubit for an item that they found on Amazon.co.uk, but not for an item listed on Amazon.de. The same applies to the customer's delivery address. Flubit currently offers its service for orders that have a delivery address in the United Kingdom. The company is currently planning to expand its business model to other countries.

In short: At the moment, you can only offer your products to customers in the UK.
If you typically sell in a different language, don't forget that any items you offer on Flubit need to be available in English.
